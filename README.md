# A PyTorch repo for Planet: Understanding the Amazon from Space Kaggle Competition.

This repository's main objective is to serve as a starting point to [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/). The parts that are covered are:
- A simple data loader that inherits `torch.utils.data.Dataset`. Add default transformations from `torchvision.transforms`.
- Definition of a simple convolutional network and all necessary building blocks for training/validation.
- Loading pretrained models e.g. DenseNet, ResNet, VGG and finetuning.
- Visualizing training in tensorboard.
- Predicting on new images.
